    "\n",
    "## How can we use the knowledge from one EEG Decoding task into another?\n",
    "\n",
    "Transfer learning is a widespread technique used in deep learning. It uses knowledge learned from one source task/domain in another target task/domain. It has been studied in depth in computer vision, natural language processing, and speech, but what about EEG brain decoding?\n",
    "\n",
    "The cross-task transfer learning scenario in EEG decoding is remarkably underexplored in comparison to the developers of new models, [Aristimunha et al., (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02408), even though it can be much more useful for real applications, see [Wimpff et al. (2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06828), [Wu et al. (2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09882).\n",
    "\n",
    "Our Challenge 1 addresses a key goal in neurotechnology: decoding cognitive function from EEG using the pre-trained knowledge from another. In other words, developing models that can effectively transfer/adapt/adjust/fine-tune knowledge from passive EEG tasks to active tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "The ability to generalize and transfer is something critical that we believe should be focused. To go beyond just comparing metrics numbers that are often not comparable, given the specificities of EEG, such as pre-processing, inter-subject variability, and many other unique components of this type of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means your submitted model might be trained on a subset of tasks and fine-tuned on data from another condition, evaluating its capacity to generalize with task-specific fine-tuning."

    "# The brain decodes the problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Broadly speaking, here *brain decoding* is the following problem: given brain time-series signals $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{C \\times T}$ with labels $y \\in \\mathcal{Y}$, we implement a neural network $f$ that **decodes/translates** brain activity into the target label.\n",
    "\n",
    "We aim to translate recorded brain activity into its originating stimulus, behavior, or mental state, [King, J-R. et al. (2020)](https://lauragwilliams.github.io/d/m/CognitionAlgorithm.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "The neural network $f$ applies a series of transformation layers (e.g., `torch.nn.Conv2d`, `torch.nn.Linear`, `torch.nn.ELU`, `torch.nn.BatchNorm2d`) to the data to filter, extract features, and learn embeddings relevant to the optimization objective—in other words:\n",

    "\n",
    "For a machine-learning audience: one participant performs a simple two-choice perceptual decision **while EEG is recorded continuously**. The stimulus remains on the screen; at unpredictable times one side **gradually** becomes higher contrast.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Contrast Change Detection task relates to [Steady-State Visual Evoked Potentials (SSVEP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steady-state_visually_evoked_potential) and [Event-Related Potentials (ERP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-related_potential).\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithmically, what the subject sees during recording is:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Two flickering striped discs: one tilted left, one tilted right.\n",
    "* After a variable delay, **one disc’s contrast gradually increases** **while the other decreases**.\n",
    "* They **press left or right** to indicate which disc got stronger.\n",
    "* They receive **feedback** (🙂 correct / 🙁 incorrect).\n",
    "\n",
    "**The task parallels SSVEP and ERP:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The continuous flicker **tags the EEG at fixed frequencies (and harmonics)** → SSVEP-like signals.\n",
    "* The **ramp onset**, the **button press**, and the **feedback** are **time-locked events** that yield ERP-like components.\n",
    "\n",
    "So CCD mixes **frequency-tagged (SSVEP)** and **event-locked (ERP)** information, giving signals that can be decoded.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Typical parameters (commonly used):** different flicker rates for the two tilts (e.g., 20 Hz & 25 Hz); a **\\~1.6 s** linear ramp up/down; **\\~0.8 s** return to baseline; inter-target intervals of a few seconds; brief visual feedback.\n",
