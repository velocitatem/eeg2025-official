    "## Predicting psychopathological trait from EEG and behavioral data\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding biomarkers for psychopathology has always been a golden goal. As behavioral symptoms can be confounding between different pathologies the hope is that physiology signals give a more precise way of stratifying patients. Furthermore, collecting clinical data is costly while there are more abundant data resource that are non-clinincal and available. In this challenge, you will explore how to leverage large data recording to predict clinical factor in a non-supervised manner. We hope that you can advance clinical diagnosis for adolescent!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this start kit, we will show you how to obtain the data for the challenge as well as preprocess and format it into a form processable by deep learning using EEGDash and Braindecode. We will then show an example of using Self-Supervised Learning to train the model on the data without labels, and fine-tune it for clinical prediction at inference time. This is by no means a requirement of the competition. The goal is to give you an jumping-off point and some inspiration. We will provide some suggestions of areas to explore at the end of the start kit, but feel free to be creative and choose whichever approach you see fit for the problem!\n"

    "\n",
    "Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) has been shown to be an effective training paradigm to learn robust representation from the data without label. There are many different SSL \"pre-text\" tasks that one can use. In fact, figuring out which pre-text task is most effective for the data and the downstream tasks of interest is an important open research area. Here we will implement a pre-text task called Relative Positioning (RP) that has been applied to learn clinically meaningful representation from EEG data [Banville et al., (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.16104). RP is a contrastive learning method where we randomly sample pairs of positive and negative EEG windows and train the model to predict this relationship in the embedding space. Braindecode already has a sampler for RP which we will use. For more detailed explanation of the task, check out the linked paper as well as this [tutorial](https://braindecode.org/stable/auto_examples/advanced_training/plot_relative_positioning.html) on braindecode.org\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we train the RP task on the entire dataset without ever seeing the p-factor label. Later on, we will \"fine-tune\" the embedding model trained with SSL on labeled data for our p-factor prediction."
