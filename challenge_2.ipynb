The goal is not only to minimize error on seen subjects, but also to transfer effectively to unseen data.\n\nEnsure the dataset is available locally. If not, see the [dataset download guide](https://eeg2025.github.io/data/#downloading-the-data)"

Understanding the P-factor regression task.\n\nThe psychopathology factor (P-factor) is a widely recognized construct in mental health research, representing a common underlying dimension of psychopathology across various disorders.\nThe P-factor is thought to reflect the shared variance among different psychiatric conditions, suggesting that individuals with higher P-factor scores may be more vulnerable to a range of mental health issues.\nCurrently, the P-factor is often assessed using self-report questionnaires or clinician ratings, which can be subjective, prone to bias, and time-consuming.\nIn the dataset of this challenge, the P-factor was assessed using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) [McElroy et al., (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1111/jcpp.12849).\n\nThe goal of Challenge 2 is to develop a model to predict the P-factor from EEG recordings.\n**The feasibility of using EEG data for this purpose is still an open question**.\nThe solution may involve finding meaningful representations of the EEG data that correlate with the P-factor scores.\nThe challenge encourages learning physiologically meaningful signal representations and discovery of reproducible biomarkers.\nIf contestants are successful in this task, it could pave the way for more objective and efficient assessments of the P-factor in clinical settings."
