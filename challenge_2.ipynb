    "# Challenge 2: Predicting the p-factor from EEG\n",
    "\n",
    "The psychopathology factor (P-factor) is a widely recognized construct in mental health research, representing a common underlying dimension of psychopathology across various disorders.\n",
    "Currently, the P-factor is often assessed using self-report questionnaires or clinician ratings, which can be subjective, prone to bias, and time consuming.\n",
    "**The Challenge 2** consists of developing a model to predict the P-factor from EEG recordings.\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge encourages learning physiologically meaningful signal representations and discovery of reproducible biomarkers.\n",
    "Models of any size should emphasize robust, interpretable features that generalize across subjects,\n",
    "sessions, and acquisition sites.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike a standard in-distribution classification task, this regression problem stresses out-of-distribution robustness\n",
    "and extrapolation. The goal is not only to minimize error on seen subjects, but also to transfer effectively to unseen data.\n",
