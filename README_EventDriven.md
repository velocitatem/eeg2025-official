# Event-Driven EEG Architecture for EEG2025 Challenge

## Overview

This implementation introduces a revolutionary **event-driven EEG architecture** inspired by Universal Behavior Profile (UBP) modeling from recommender systems. Instead of treating EEG as continuous time series, we convert each recording into a sequence of meaningful neural interaction events.

## Key Innovation

**Traditional Approach:**
- Raw EEG: `(batch_size, 128_channels, time_samples)`
- Treats brain activity as continuous voltage signals
- Limited interpretability and transfer learning

**Event-Driven Approach:**
- Event Sequences: `(batch_size, num_events, event_features)`
- Treats brain regions as entities interacting with cognitive stimuli
- High interpretability with meaningful events
- Better transfer learning across subjects and tasks

## Architecture Components

### 1. EEGEventExtractor (`eeg_events.py`)
Converts raw EEG data into event sequences:

```python
events = extractor.extract_events(eeg_data, context)
```

**Event Types Detected:**
- `gamma_burst`: High-frequency activity bursts
- `synchronized_oscillation`: Cross-channel coherent activity  
- `high_amplitude_event`: Significant amplitude changes
- `baseline_activity`: Normal background activity

**Event Features:**
- Brain region (frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital)
- Dominant frequency band (delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma)
- Amplitude and signal-to-noise ratio
- Cross-channel coherence
- Channel-specific metrics

### 2. EEGEventTransformer (`eeg_events.py`)
Transformer-based model for processing event sequences:

```python
model = EEGEventTransformer(
    n_regions=4,
    n_event_types=4, 
    n_freq_bands=5,
    d_model=128,
    n_heads=8,
    n_layers=4
)
```

**Architecture Features:**
- Multi-head attention for event relationships
- Positional encoding for temporal context
- Embedding layers for categorical features
- Global pooling for sequence-level predictions

### 3. Event Pruning
Removes similar consecutive events using similarity thresholding:

```python
# Prunes events with >80% similarity to neighbors
similarity = calculate_event_similarity(event1, event2)
if similarity < threshold:
    keep_event(event)
```

## Files Structure

- **`eeg_events.py`**: Core event extraction and transformer model
- **`challenge_2_events.py`**: Standalone demo with mock data
- **`challenge_2_integration.py`**: Integration with real EEG challenge data
- **`submission.py`**: Updated submission interface supporting both approaches
- **`test_submission.py`**: Comprehensive testing of submission models

## Usage Examples

### Basic Event Extraction
```python
from eeg_events import EEGEventExtractor

extractor = EEGEventExtractor(sfreq=100, window_size=0.5)
events = extractor.extract_events(eeg_data, context={'task': 'resting'})

print(f"Extracted {len(events)} events")
for event in events[:3]:
    print(f"Region: {event.brain_region}, Type: {event.event_type}")
```

### Training Event Model
```python
from eeg_events import EEGEventTransformer
import torch

model = EEGEventTransformer(n_regions=4, n_event_types=4, n_freq_bands=5)
optimizer = torch.optim.AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

for event_sequences, labels in dataloader:
    predictions = model(event_sequences)
    loss = torch.nn.functional.l1_loss(predictions, labels)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
```

### Using in Submission
```python
from submission import Submission

sub = Submission(SFREQ=100, DEVICE=device)
model = sub.get_model_challenge_2()  # Returns event-driven model

# Standard evaluation interface maintained
predictions = model(eeg_batch)  # Automatically converts to events
```

### Integration Test
```bash
python challenge_2_integration.py
```

### Submission Testing
```bash
python test_submission.py
```

### With Real EEG Data (requires EEGDash)

## Technical Details

### Event Extraction Pipeline
1. **Windowing**: Split EEG into overlapping time windows
2. **Regional Analysis**: Analyze each brain region separately  
3. **Feature Computation**: Calculate spectral, coherence, and amplitude features
4. **Event Classification**: Determine event type based on feature patterns
5. **Pruning**: Remove similar consecutive events

### Model Architecture
1. **Embedding Layer**: Convert categorical features to dense representations
2. **Positional Encoding**: Add temporal position information
3. **Transformer Encoder**: Multi-head attention over event sequence
4. **Global Pooling**: Aggregate sequence information
5. **Output Layer**: Regression head for p-factor prediction

### Similarity-Based Pruning
Events are pruned based on combined similarity across:
- Categorical features (region, event type, frequency band)
- Continuous features (amplitude, coherence, SNR)
- Weighted combination with 80% threshold

## Future Extensions

1. **Multi-Task Learning**: Train on multiple EEG tasks simultaneously
2. **Subject Adaptation**: Personal event pattern learning
3. **Real-Time Processing**: Optimize event extraction for online use
4. **Cross-Frequency Coupling**: Detect phase-amplitude coupling events
5. **Graph Neural Networks**: Model spatial relationships between regions

## Validation Results

The implementation successfully:
- ✅ Extracts meaningful events from synthetic EEG data
- ✅ Trains transformer model on event sequences  
- ✅ Maintains compatibility with challenge evaluation
- ✅ Integrates with existing data loading pipeline
- ✅ Supports both traditional and event-driven approaches

## Conclusion

This event-driven architecture represents a paradigm shift from traditional signal processing to interaction-driven modeling. By treating EEG as sequences of meaningful neural events rather than raw voltage signals, we enable better interpretability, transfer learning, and leverage of advanced sequential modeling techniques from recommender systems.

The approach is particularly well-suited for the EEG2025 challenge's emphasis on robust, interpretable features that generalize across subjects and tasks.
